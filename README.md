# US-ACCIDENTS-EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS
In this exploratory data analysis, we are going to analyse data of accidents happened in various cities of US.

I got this dataset from kaggle. Kaggle is site where you can get real world datasets for analysis., which will be useful for modifications in that field.
## Insights
1. The top 5 states by accidents include populous ones like Los Angeles, Houston, and Florida.
2. Less than 5% (~ 4.35%) of cities have more than 1000 accidents in the period between February 2016 and December 2020.
3. New York is a populous city that has had less than 7500 accidents in the accounting period.
4. Over 1200 cities have had just one accident in 4yeaars- needs further investigation.
5. The majority of them have witnessed between 10–100 accidents during the period.
6. Accidents by cities follow an exponentially decreasing distribution.
7. The hypothesis that weekdays see more accidents during morning and evening rush hours is corroborated by the data. Weekends have the peak during the afternoon.
8. The year-wise analysis seems to show missing data about certain months. So nothing much can be conclusively said about the overall increasing trend in the latter half of the year.
